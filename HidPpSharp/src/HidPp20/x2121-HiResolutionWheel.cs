/// <summary>
/// Reporting of hi-res wheel events.
/// A hi-res wheel must have a freewheel or microratchet mode (more than one microratchet per
/// normal scroll unit) to make the high resolution useful. It may have a user controlled mechanism to
/// switch to normal ratchet mode. If this ratchet control is motorized or has a mechanical switch for
/// the firmware to detect the state, then the wheel has the "ratchet switch" capability described in this
/// feature.
/// The high-resolution setting is applied both when the wheel is reported natively via HID and when
/// diverted to software.
/// The invert setting applies only to values reported natively via HID. Values report via HID++ are
/// unaffected. When active it causes reporting of the additive inverse of normal wheel motion.
/// Normal motion reporting gives positive values when the wheel is moved away from the user.
/// Inverted motion reporting gives negative values when the wheel is moved away from the user.
/// The period count reported is the number of reporting periods that motion took to be reported. It
/// will normally be 1, but may be greater when the HID report is delayed due to HID++ reports being
/// sent. The initial periods of no motion preceding the first motion report do not count towards the
/// number of periods.
